            <p class="column3-text">Using the NRC Word-Emotion Lexicon, we applied dictionary matching methods onto Yelp reviews to generate sentiment scores for each restaurant in the dataset. The NRC Word-Emotion Lexicon is a collection of words tagged with positive and negative sentiments as well as the following eight emotions: anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, and trust.<br><br>Sentiment scores were generated based on the number of tokens belonging to each emotion/sentiment divided by the total number of tokens in the document (i.e. the collection of reviews for a restaurant). These scores were fed into our Random Forest Classifier.</p>

We also joined descriptive features about cuisine type, price, and ratings from Yelp, as well as the sentiment scores generated from our analysis of Yelp reviews. </p>
