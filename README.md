# The Project
Restaurant inspections are critical to maintaining public health by identifying unsanitary practices that could lead to an outbreak of foodborne illness. Every year, the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) conducts random inspections on New York City’s 24,000 restaurants, looking for potential health code violations. These violations vary in severity, with those that are most likely to contribute to foodborne illness being flagged as “critical violations”. 

Our study employs several predictive classifiers to derive a model to predict the likelihood that a restaurant will be flagged with a critical violation based on features such as past violations, and restaurant characteristics. The purpose of this study is to help the DOHMH prioritize inspections for restaurants which are at risk of violating more serious health codes.  

This capstone project is submitted by Adley Kim (ak3940), Qiuyao Liu (ql459) and Kloe Ng (kyn227), as part of the NYU CUSP capstone project 2019.
