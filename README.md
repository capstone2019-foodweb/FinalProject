# The Project
Restaurant inspections are critical to maintaining public health by identifying unsanitary practices that could lead to an outbreak of foodborne illness. Every year, the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) conducts random inspections on New York City’s 24,000 restaurants, looking for potential health code violations. These violations vary in severity, with those that are most likely to contribute to foodborne illness being flagged as “critical violations”. 

Our study employs several predictive classifiers to derive a model to predict the likelihood that a restaurant will be flagged with a critical violation based on features such as past violations, and restaurant characteristics. The purpose of this study is to help the DOHMH prioritize inspections for restaurants which are at risk of violating more serious health codes.  

This capstone project is submitted by Adley Kim (ak3940), Qiuyao Liu (ql459) and Kloe Ng (kyn227), as part of the NYU CUSP capstone project 2019. 

# FinalProject
This Repository contains all the data (open-sourced), code and submissions for the Final Capstone Project for NYU CUSP 2019.

# 1) Data
This folder contains the cleaned CSV files used for our modeling (Folder 'Data.Zip')

# 2) Code
This folder contains the ipython notebooks used to run the modeling as well as to churn out the visualizations (Folder 'Code'). 

# 3) Websites
There are a total of 3 websites submitted for this project.
i)   Visualization of data (data exploration)
ii)  Project Website. 
iii) Website with map showing the predictive score that a restaurant will have two or more critical violations. 
The files can be found in the rest of the files (Folder 'Img' as well as index.html, map.css, map.html, map.js, style.css, viomap.geojson) 


# Accessing the Files
It is recommended to do a local gitclone as the files are too big. The ipython notebooks (Code) can be read by referencing the CSV files in the Data folder.

The team would like to thank Dr. Andy Karpf (Mentor) and Introspective Systems (Sponsor) for their guidance and support throughout this capstone project.
